XMPP provider:
* Add Unit Tests
* Add Functional Tests
* Send to rooms? I haven't tried that
* Register the user? Haven't tried that.

Other Providers:
* IRC
* Discord
* Slack (if I can't figure out how to get that mainlined with a good ext auth integration... their oauth is a pain)
* ... Whatever else is hanging out on the feature site that sounds interesting
